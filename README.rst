===========
mkl-service
===========

This package exposes a few functions which are declared in mkl_service.h.
The main purpose of the package is to allow the user to change the number
of CPU's MKL is using at runtime.


Example:
--------

In this small example, we first query how many CPU are being used, and then
change this number.

   >>> import mkl
   >>> mkl.get_max_threads()
   4
   >>> mkl.set_num_threads(1)
   >>> mkl.get_max_threads()
   1


Reference
---------

**mkl service functions:**

``mkl.get_cpu_clocks()`` -> int
   Return the CPU clocks as an integer.


``mkl.get_cpu_frequency()`` -> float
   Return CPU frequency in GHz as a float.


``mkl.get_max_threads()`` -> int
   Return the number of threads Intel MKL is targeting for parallelism.


``mkl.get_version_string()`` -> str
   Return the MKL library version information as a string.


``mkl.mem_stat()`` -> (int, int)
   Returns a tuple (bytes, count) containing memory usage statistics of the
   MKL allocator
   - number of bytes allocated (bytes).
   - number of allocated blocks (count).


``mkl.set_num_threads(n)``
   Set the number of threads MKL should use.  This is only a hint, and no
   guaranteed is made this number of threads will actually be used.
   This function takes precedence over the environment variable
   MKL_NUM_THREADS.
